ITSECWB Milestone 1

Group 16

Directions:

1. You will need XAMPP and PHPMyAdmin
2. Get file named kapekada.sql and import it into PHPMyAdmin
3. Ensure that the project folder is found in your xampp/htdocs 
4. Make sure that the credentials in db_connection.php is correct, you MUST change the password!
5. Make sure that Apache and MySQL are running in your XAMPP Control Panel.
6. After ensuring the things from before, you can now direct yourself to localhost/(insert the folder name where this project is located)


NOTE: The dummy users inserted into the database do not have hashed passwords. Signing up on signup.php will ensure that the passwords are hashed with salt rounds before being inserted into the database.
